# CMake Preset Demo

### Brief:
This repo contains a project in modern C++ meant for generating derivatives for any algebraic function. Work in progress.

### Required Tools & Languages:
 - Git & GitHub set up properly
 - VSCode editor
   - clangd extension
   - CMake support extension
 - CMake 3.28+
   - Make, ninja, or some other native build system...

### Notes:
 - *nix or WSL setups with GCC installed will likely work.

### To-Do's:
 ~~1. Add GitHub Actions config to try building and then running component tests.~~ (WON'T FIX)
 2. Create emitter for AST to function model.
 3. Add REPL logic to prompt for equations to derive / evaluate derivative at some x.
